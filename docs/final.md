Subtitle: Open Source Learning

Semester: Fall 2022

Overview:
     Our application allows an end user to get tutoring for any Computer Science class at UMass Amherst. It additionally allows the user to watch and add videos on important coding and studying techniques which in turn provides a great studying enviornment. Our application is innovative due to the fact that there isn't a dedicated website for people to get tutoring for specifically computer science classes. In addition, the resources page is something that isn't common on tutoring pages

User Interface:
    The user is greeted with the login page(insert image). Oncne the user logins in or creates an account the Open Source Learning home page will appear (insert image). The nav bar at the top allows the user to navigate the website with ease. The classes page (insert image) gives the user a list of the possible CS classes they can take as well as request a tutor for. The next tab, resources (inser image) is a place where the user can watch videos posted by other students as well as post a video themselves that they may have found helpful. The next tab Request Tutor is the heart of the application. This allows the user to create a request for a tutor that will in turn appear on the tutee list, which happens to be the next tab (insert image). Once the user hits the submit button in the request tutor page, their request will appear here where a tutor can see it and decide to help the user out! Finally the about us page (insert image) is just a page that lets the user know who createad the website they are using! Aside from the nav bar, there is a drop-down menu (insert image) that has multiple other pages. The update profile page (insert image) allows the user to make changes to any one of their tutoring requests. The create profile simply brings you to the request tutor page where you can create your profile. And last but not least the Log out button which simply logs you out of the website. 

Division of Labor:
    Jerry Du: login backend, authentication and authorization, worked on tutee list front end and back end, request tutor front end and back end
    Gordon Chen: resources front end and back end, tutee list backend, update profile frontend and backend
    Hadi Abdelghany: classes frontend, login page frontend, login backend, update profile front end, about us page

Conclusion:
    Overall working on the project was a great experience and we have all learned a lot. Some things include how to connect frontend to backend as well as how a database fits into both front and backend. In addition, we learned a lot of new html and css tricks that allowed the frontend of our website to come alive. We ran into issues mainly in the backend with database interaction and moving database information from backend to frontend and vice versa moving frontend information to the database. Something that would have helped was having more experience with backend and database work cause thats where almost all of our troubles lied
