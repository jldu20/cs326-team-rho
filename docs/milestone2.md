Part 0: Project API Planning
Before you write any code, you will need to think of how the client should obtain information from the back-end server. Whether you use RESTful APIs or using other types of APIs, you will need to have different endpoints to provide different functionalities for the users. You will need to write out all APIs the server will provide with a brief description for each. You can also include examples of input and output. 
Alternatively, you can draw out a flow-chart with the information.
Put all this information in docs/milestone2.md
