4. Innovative Idea:
    Our idea is to create a general purpose tutoring app where people can view and submit resources for specific cources and make a request for tutoring that other people are able to see. Each post contains the cource in detail and a description, along with any offer/free and general location to schedule meet ups. This app allows people to discover new learning materials while also offering a stress free way of meeting up with tutors who are knowledgeable and have done well in that course. It also allows users to share great resources that they find online to others.

5. Important Components:
    openlearning.com will provide a place for students to connect with
    tutors who can help with certain cources in a major. It will provide discussion forms under each course as well where anyone can post resources/videos that helped them learn certain concepts. openlearning.com will also help with scheduling a general location and time for the student and tutor to meet up
